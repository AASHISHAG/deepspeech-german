# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) - DeepSpeech German

_This is the project for the paper [German End-to-end Speech Recognition based on DeepSpeech]() published at [KONVENS 2019](https://2019.konvens.org/)._

This project aims to develop a working Speech to Text module using [Mozilla DeepSpeech]() for the Red Hen Labâ€™s current Audio processing pipeline. [Mozillla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) is a state-of-the-art open source automatic speech recognition (ASR) toolkit. DeepSpeech is using a model trained by machine learning techniques based on [Baidu's Deep Speech](https://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/deep_speech3_12_17.pdf) research paper. Project DeepSpeech uses Google's TensorFlow to make the implementation easier.
